If you're willing to open your mind and look beyond the words, though, you'll find there are lessons to be applied. Plus, the characters and world-building are top tier.</td>

                <td class="muted">Kind of an odd pick, sure, but I've never seen another show that so gratuitously give out life lessons. Each episode dishes out real-world examples of school, love, and career-relared things. Seeing someone else go through these things helps cement them! I use the 2 o'clock rule every time I'm going to make a decision that could haunt me...</td>

When you're watching this, ask yourself when "working hard" and sticking to doing what you're told can become too much.</td>
