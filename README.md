## Site Purpose
This site serves as a personal portfolio and reading/watching log: a place to experiment with web design, document what I’m consuming (books, shows, essays), and build a durable home base online beyond templated platforms (looking at you, WordPress). It’s both a playground and a proof-of-concept for my (hopefully) evolving technical & design skills.

## Structure  

This site has a few key files:

- `/index.html` – in terms of the website from a user's perspective, this is the home/landing page with all my current recs  
- `/about.html` – this is a biography page, with an about me section! 
- `/reading.html` – this is an extended recommendations/reading list page, specifically with my 'Top 5' media.  
- `/references.html` – this is where I keep the links and resources I’ve used (documentation, inspiration)  
- `/styles/` – CSS folder
