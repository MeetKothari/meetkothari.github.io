# Site Purpose
This site serves as a personal portfolio and reading/watching log: a place to experiment with web design, document what I’m consuming (books, shows, essays), and build a durable home base online beyond templated platforms (looking at you, WordPress). It’s both a playground and a proof-of-concept for my (hopefully) evolving technical & design skills.
